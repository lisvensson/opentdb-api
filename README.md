# Quiz App using Open Trivia Database

This project was created as part of a school assignment focused on learning how to fetch data from public APIs using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
The application allows users to generate customized quizzes using [Open Trivia Database API](https://opentdb.com/) â€” an open-source API with thousands of trivia questions.
